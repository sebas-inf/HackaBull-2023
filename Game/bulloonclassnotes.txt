variables:
health, speed, xpos, ypos

when balloon object is initialized the one parameter should be health.

health determines the "level" of the balloon

etc

speed should be set based on health

draw() #draws the balloon
get_pos() #returns tuple: (x,y)
update() #handles "moving" the balloons and checks to see if they got hit

# if health = 1 when pop is called, set health to 0 and delete self
